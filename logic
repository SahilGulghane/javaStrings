we have ascii value for each character given

lowercase - uppercase = 32

ex
a(97) - A(41) =32

so for lower case we have formula

uppercase + 32  = lowercase
ex 41(a) + 32 = 97 (A)

and for uppercase we have

lowercase - 32 = uppercase
ex 97(A) - 32 = 41(a)


for considering space ex my name is sahil
we have to identify space as identify we have to put same data else convert to upper case  or lowercase as need
ascii value of space is 32 ...

for 1st alphabet we have to identify space as space come then move pointer to next location


output
function1
Enter a string: MY NAME IS SAHIL
entered string: MYNAMEISSAHIL
mynameissahil

function2
Enter a string: my name is sahil
